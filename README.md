# Custom Language Compiler

## Overview

This repository contains a compiler for a custom language, designed to showcase the fundamentals of compiler construction. This project covers key phases such as lexical analysis, syntax parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation, focusing on translating high-level language constructs into machine code.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenization of source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Syntax Parsing**: Construction of an abstract syntax tree (AST) to represent the grammatical structure of the source code.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Validation of the AST for semantic correctness, including type checking.
- **Code Generation**: Conversion of the validated AST into executable machine code.

## Built With

- **C++**: Primary language for the core compiler logic.
